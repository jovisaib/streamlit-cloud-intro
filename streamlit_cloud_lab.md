# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Laboratory

## Learning Objectives
- Deploy a Streamlit application to Streamlit Cloud
- Configure a GitHub repository for cloud deployment
- Understand the deployment workflow for data applications

## Task Overview
In this lab, you will deploy a data visualization application to Streamlit Cloud. You'll set up a GitHub repository, create the necessary configuration files, and deploy the application to make it publicly accessible.

## Required Steps

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment
- Create a new directory for your project
- Set up a virtual environment
- Install required packages: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`

### 2. Create Your Application Files
- Create `app.py` with a data visualization application
  - Must include at least one interactive element (slider, dropdown, etc.)
  - Must include at least one visualization (chart, graph, etc.)
  - Should have a clean, professional appearance
- Create `requirements.txt` listing all dependencies
- Create `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Create a `README.md` with basic information about your app

### 3. Set Up GitHub Repository
- Initialize a Git repository
- Create a new public repository on GitHub
- Connect your local repository to GitHub
- Push your code to GitHub

### 4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- Sign up for Streamlit Cloud using your GitHub account
- Deploy your application by connecting to your repository
- Verify that your application is working correctly
- Make at least one change to your application and observe the automatic redeployment

## Deliverables
To complete this lab, submit:

1. **GitHub Repository URL**: The URL of your GitHub repository containing your Streamlit application code
2. **Deployed Application URL**: The URL of your deployed Streamlit Cloud application
3. **Screenshot**: A screenshot of your working application

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- Successful deployment to Streamlit Cloud
- Functionality of the deployed application
- Code organization and quality
- Visual appeal and user experience of the application
- Proper configuration of all required files
